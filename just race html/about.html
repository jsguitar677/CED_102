            <h1>Our Goal</h1>
            <p>The racing experience starts by suiting up in a professional race suit and helmet. Then learn the curves in a state-of-the-art simulator session where the Las Vegas racetrack has been laser scanned to exact specifications. Nowhere else in
                the world will you find such a driving experience. We knew this experience could only take place on a real track with a real racing car. The real challenge was to develop an experience, from beginning to end, that was complementary to
                the Ferrari lifestyle and synonymous with its name. After having hosted multiple corporate events and team building activities we can confidently say that this goal has been achieved.”
